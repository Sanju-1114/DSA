# DSA - C++ Code Snippets

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs demonstrating fundamental concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Each file focuses on a specific topic, such as loops, pointers, functions, bitwise operations, and more. These programs are designed for educational purposes to help beginners understand core programming concepts.

## Overview
The repository includes C++ programs covering essential programming constructs and algorithms, such as:
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Conditional statements
- Bitwise operations
- Functions for calculations (e.g., factorial, binomial coefficient)
- Number system conversions (decimal to binary, binary to decimal)
- Mathematical computations (e.g., power calculation using binary exponentiation)
- Prime number checking

Each file is self-contained and includes commented code for clarity.

## How to Clone
To clone this repository, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sanju-1114/DSA.git
```

## Files Description
Below is a brief description of each file in the repository:

- **binaryNumberSystem.cpp**: Contains commented functions for converting decimal to binary and binary to decimal numbers.
- **bitwise.cpp**: Demonstrates bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, left shift, right shift) and includes a commented function for reversing a number.
- **compute_x_n_power.cpp**: Implements a binary exponentiation algorithm to compute \( x^n \) efficiently, handling edge cases like negative exponents.
- **conditional_statement.cpp**: Uses an if-else statement to check if a user-input number is positive or negative.
- **do_while_loop.cpp**: Shows the usage of a do-while loop to print numbers from 1 to \( n \).
- **for_loop.cpp**: Demonstrates a for loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
- **functions.cpp**: Contains commented functions for various tasks, such as printing messages, calculating sums, finding minimums, computing factorials, and calculating binomial coefficients.
- **pointers.cpp**: Explores pointer concepts, including pointer initialization, arithmetic, comparison, and null pointers.
- **prime_or_not.cpp**: Checks if a given number is prime using a loop up to the square root of the number.
- **while_loop.cpp**: Illustrates a while loop to print numbers from 1 to \( n \).   etc.


## Prerequisites
To compile and run the programs, you need:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` from GCC)
- A terminal or IDE (e.g., VS Code, Code::Blocks)
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming


## How to Compile and Run
1. **Navigate to the repository folder**:
   ```bash
   cd DSA
   ```
2. **Compile a specific file** (e.g., `for_loop.cpp`):
   ```bash
   g++ for_loop.cpp -o for_loop
   ```
3. **Run the compiled program**:
   ```bash
   ./for_loop
   ```
   On Windows, use:
   ```bash
   for_loop.exe
   ```

Repeat the above steps for other files. Ensure you have write permissions in the directory.

## Contributing
